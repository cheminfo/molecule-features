  Sun et al. collected a dataset of the flashpoints of 10575 molecules from 
  academic papers, the Gelest chemical catalogue, the DIPPR database, 
  Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, the Hazardous Chemicals Handbook,
  and the PubChem database.
  Includes flashpoints measured with both open and closed cup methods.
